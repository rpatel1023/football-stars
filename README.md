#Football Stars

Football Stars was created for the final project in Intro to Embedded Systems at the University of Texas at Austin.

The object is to score 3 touchdowns in a row at the famous Darrell K. Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium, home of the Texas Longhorns!

The game utilizes a DAC, Slide Potentiometer, LCD, ISRs, and multiple buttons.
